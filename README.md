# Intrepid-tourists  
Problem Statement:    
➢ In the present system a customer has to approach various agencies to find details of places and to book tickets.    
➢ This often requires a lot of time and effort.    
➢ The tourism management system allows one to easily access the relevant information and make necessary travel arrangements online.   
➢ It keeps track of the user details registered for a particular tour, the guide allocated.   
➢ Updation or cancellation of the tour is allowed provided it's done few days before commencement of the tour.
  
Concept:    
➢ We have provided separate provision for admin and user login.  
➢ Once the user gives his credentials and clicks the log in button, it will lead the user to the home page.   
➢ According to the user’s convenience, he/she can choose a specific place and book a convenient package.   
➢ There is a provision to check if the user has done any previous bookings and he/she can update or cancel the tour provided it’s done few days prior to the commencement of the tour.   
➢ If the user has any queries regarding the tour, he/she can provide the details in the contact form.  
➢ The admin login leads the admin to change the package cost and tourist spots included.
